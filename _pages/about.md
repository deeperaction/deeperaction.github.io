## Aims and Scope

DeeperAction aims to advance the area of human action understanding with a shift from traditional action recognition to deeper understanding tasks of action, with a focus on localized and detailed understanding of human action from videos in the wild. Specifically, we benchmark three related tasks on localized and detailed action understanding by introducing newly-annotated and high-quality datasets, and organize the action understanding challenge on these benchmarks.

### [Temporal action Localization](https://deeperaction.github.io/fineaction "Tracks1-FineAction")
Detecting all segments of containing actions of interest and recognizing their categories from a long video sequence.

### [Spatio-temporal action detection](https://deeperaction.github.io/multisports "Tracks2-MultiSports")
Localizing all action instances with spatio-temporal tubes and recognizing their labels from untrimmed and multi-person videos.

### [Part-level action parsing](/tracks/3-kineticstps/)

Decomposing the action instance into a human part graph and detecting action labels for all human parts an as well the whole human.
